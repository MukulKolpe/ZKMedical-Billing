# ZK Medical Billing
zk Medical Billing and Diagnostics on Scroll, Polygon ZKevm blockchain using Avail and zksbts with Bandada, Sindri and Aztec

ZK Usage for Scalability on Scroll: We are developing tools to enable tracing, monitoring and recording of medical invoices in a scalable manner across an entire supply chain for efficiency and sustainability and benefit the entire medical eco-system on Scroll using Avail for data accessibility layer and Sindri for verification using circom, devops and user security. 

AIops using Avail and Sindri on Scroll: We are building Avail XLS, an on-chain analytics, visualization tool and also trying to extend the implementation of Page Rank Algorithm by Sindri to prioritize the ranking of actions (pending, draft and paid) to be undertaken on invoices. Proof generation using Sindri’s ZKML tooling in Noir.

AIops using Sindri on Scroll: We are extending the implementation of Page Rank Algorithm by Sindri to prioritize the ranking of actions (pending, draft and paid) to be undertaken on invoices depending upon the status (pending, draft and paid). Proof generation using Sindri’s ZKML tooling in Noir.
